1.2 - ?
  - Fixed some bugs on cygwin
  - Added du-like exclude patterns

1.1 - 2007-04-30
  - Deleting files and directories is now possible from
    within ncdu.
  - The key for sorting directories between files has
    changed to 't' instead of 'd'. The 'd'-key is now
    used for deleting files.

1.0 - 2007-04-06
  - First stable release
  - Small code cleanup
  - Added a key to toggle between sorting dirs before
    files and dirs between files
  - Added graphs and percentages to the directory
    browser (can be enabled or disabled with the 'g'-key)

0.3 - 2007-03-04
  - When browsing back to the previous directory, the
    directory you're getting back from will be selected.
  - Added directory scanning in quiet mode to save
    bandwidth on remote connections.

0.2 - 2007-02-26
  - Fixed POSIX compliance: replaced realpath() with my
    own implementation, and gettimeofday() is not
    required anymore (but highly recommended)
  - Added a warning for terminals smaller than 60x16
  - Mountpoints (or any other directory pointing to
    another	filesystem) are now considered to be
    directories rather than files.
