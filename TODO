Small list of planned features/changes, in no particular order.
Suggestions are always welcome.


- Add export/import feature for filelists
  * Also comparing two filelists

- Improve browser interface
  * Option to display number of files
  * Mutt-like status bar?
  * More information in file info window:
    > dev, ino, mode, gid, uid, mtime, atime, number of files

- Add custom key bindings
  * Using a config file (/etc/ncdurc, ~/.ncdurc)
  * Running external commands on the selected file

- Improved sorting configuration
  * Sort by number of files
  * Use one key to open up a menu with sort options, instead of having a
    special key for each column

- Better handling of hard links
  * Use hash table or BST to speed up hard link detection
  * Have a separate size variable for "shared" data
    (displayed in the browser as e.g. "291+3MiB")
  * Support directory hard links (on Darwin and Solaris)
    (And recognise bind-mounted paths as such on Linux?)

- Better handling of multibyte or multicolumn characters
  * strlen() <> number_of_columns() <> number_of_characters()
