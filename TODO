Small list of planned features/changes, suggestions are always welcome.


- Add export/import feature for filelists
  * Also comparing two filelists

- Improve browser interface
  * Option to display number of files
  * Mutt-like status bar?

- Add custom key bindings
  * Using a config file (/etc/ncdurc, ~/.ncdurc)
  * Running external commands on the selected file

- Improved sorting configuration
  * Sort by number of files
  * Use one key to open up a menu with sort options, instead of
    having a special key for each column

- Better handling of hard links?
  * Link the files together in the browser interface
  * Have a separate size variable for "shared" data
    (displayed in the browser as e.g. "291+3MiB")
    This should be both more intuitive and more correct than simply
    counting a semi-random occurence and ignoring others, as we do now.

- Better handling of multibyte or multicolumn characters
  * strlen() <> number_of_columns() <> number_of_characters()
