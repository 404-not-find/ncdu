Small list of planned features/changes, suggestions are always welcome.


- Improve configuration interface (settings.c)
  * All command line options should be accessible in the GUI
  * Tabs?
  * Still use the ncurses forms library, or implement our own?
    (hopefully less buggy and more control)

- Add export/import feature for filelists
  * Also comparing two filelists

- Improve browser interface
  * Mutt-like status bar?
  * Browser always on background, even on startup
